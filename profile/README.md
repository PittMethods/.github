This is the GitHub page for the [Pittsburgh Summer Methodology Series](https://www.pittmethods.com) (Pitt Methods) organization.

We provide training in state of the art statistical and research methods in a series of brief, affordable workshops for trainees (students and post-docs) and professionals (faculty and industry).  

Our offerings vary from year to year, but have included Instrument Development, Introduction to Structural Equation Modeling, Longitudinal Structural Equation Modeling, SMART Clinical Trial Designs, coding in the statistical language R, Machine Learning for Behavioral Scientists, Designing Ambulatory Assessment Studies, and Multilevel Modeling for Longitudinal Data. 

Our instructors are university faculty who regularly teach these methods as part of their standard coursework, and who each have extensive experience in applied use of the techniques, teaching brief workshops, and providing consultation to other applied scientists.  Our hands-on workshops are designed to give you the necessary knowledge and tools to implement these cutting edge methods in your own work.
